# Introduction

Beijing and a substantial part of China are experiencing chronic air pollution. The main pollutants are fine particles of PM2.5. PM2.5 consists of airborne particles that are known to influence visibility, human health and even climate. Evidence shows that exposure to PM2.5 can cause lung morbidity , serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and even death This analysis provides a set of statistical measures for key aspects of the PM2.5 pollution, on different season and weather conditions as well as its historical impact.

# Situation

A company in the environmental consulting industry is seeking to analyze the air quality in a specific city during hot and cold weather, during high-wind conditions and during precipitation. They are interested in making recommendations to the government and businesses in the region on how to mitigate the impact of weather conditions on air quality.

# Task 

The dataset consist of a table in CSV format which was provided in a Microsoft article by Oyinbooke a Senior Cloud Advocate, Click here for the #dataset.The dataset time period is between Jan 1st, 2010 to Dec 31st, 2014. 
Attribute Information:
Year: Year of data in this row
Month: Month of data in this row
Day: Day of data in this row
Hour: Hour of data in this row
PM2.5: PM2.5 concentration (ug/m³)
DEWP: Dew Point (â„ƒ)
TEMP: Temperature (â„ƒ)
PRES: Pressure (hPa)
Cbwd: Combined wind direction
Iws: Cumulated wind speed (m/s)
Is: Cumulated hours of snow
Ir: Cumulated hours of rain

**For this challenge, the task is to build a single-page dashboard to analyze the historical impact of weather conditions on air quality, and make predictions on air quality during specific weather conditions, seek insights and make recommendations to achieve the set objectives.**
